## Welcome to my presonal page 

I am Pete Luo, a first year M.Res. student in Shandong University. My research area mainly focuses on Natural Language Processing and its applications.

When I was a young kid, the first time I owned my PC and connected it to the Internet, I started to dream that I can have my personal website one day.

Now thanks to Github, the huge family for programmers and researchers all over the world, my dream comes true.

I hope I can keep learning new fancy knowledge and meeting more and more interesting people. I treat this as the goal of my whole life.

Happy research, happy programming!

Cheers!
