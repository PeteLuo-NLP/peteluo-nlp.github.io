## Welcome to my presonal page 

I am Pete Luo, a first year MRes student in Shandong University. My research area main focuses on Natural Language Processing and its applications.

When I was a young kid, the first time I owned my PC and connected to the Internet, I started to dream that one day I can have my personal website.

Now thanks to Github, which is really a huge family for programmers and researchers, my dream comes true.

I hope I can know more knowledge and meet more interesting people. I treat this as the goal for my whole life.

Happy research, happy programming!

Cheers!
